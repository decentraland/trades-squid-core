/**
 * The SQD Network Portal stream this squid ingests from.
 *
 * Prefers the SHARED portal over the public one. The shared endpoint is authenticated and raises
 * the per-query size cap (the public one rejects anything over 256 KiB with `400 Query is too
 * large`, which is what stalled the marketplace squid's Polygon reindex). This squid's filters are
 * small, so the cap is not the reason here — the shared endpoint is simply the one with capacity:
 * the public stream intermittently answers `503 No available workers to serve the request`.
 *
 * Falls back to the public endpoint when no key is configured, so a deployment whose environment
 * does not map the key yet keeps ingesting instead of crash-looping on boot. Once
 * `SQD_PORTAL_API_KEY` is wired for every trades service, that branch is dead code and can go.
 *
 * The host is overridable because this endpoint has already moved once: a replacement should not
 * require shipping new code. The key is env-only and must never be committed.
